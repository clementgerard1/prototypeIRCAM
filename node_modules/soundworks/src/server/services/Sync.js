 * Interface for the server `'sync'` service.

 * This service acts as the master clock provider for the client sync service,
 * in order to synchronize the clocks of the different clients to its own clock.
 *
 * __*The service must be used with its [client-side counterpart]{@link module:soundworks/client.Sync}*__
 *
 * **Note:** the service is based on [`github.com/collective-soundworks/sync`](https://github.com/collective-soundworks/sync).
 *
 * @memberof module:soundworks/server
 * @example
 * // inside the experience constructor
 * this.sync = this.require('sync');
 * // when the experience has started
 * const syncTime = this.sync.getSyncTime();
