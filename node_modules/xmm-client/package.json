  "readme": "# xmm-client\n### XMM model decoders for the browser\n\nThis library is intended to be used with the\n[original XMM library](https://github.com/Ircam-RnD/xmm), or its Node.js wrapper\n[xmm-node](https://github.com/Ircam-RnD/xmm-node), which takes care of turning phrases\nand training sets into statistical models, besides allowing to do exactly the same\nthings as xmm-client, server-side.\n\nxmm-client contains 4 classes :\n- PhraseMaker, which eases the creation of XMM-compatible phrases\n(i.e. time series recordings of dimension n, packed with metadata into JS objects),\nthat can then be passed to XMM.\n- SetMaker, which eases the management of training sets, aka collections of Phrases.\nA SetMaker should only contain phrases with the same configuration (bimodality, dimension,\ninput dimension, column names), only labels and lengths may vary.\nTraining sets can also be passed to XMM directly to generate a corresponding GMM\nor HHMM model.\n- GmmDecoder, which takes a GMM model generated by XMM and outputs\nsome estimation results when it's fed with an input vector\n- HhmmDecoder, which does the same with a Hierarchical HMM model generated by XMM.\n\n#### installation :\n\n`npm install [--save] Ircam-RnD/xmm-client`\n\n#### documentation :\n\n[https://ircam-rnd.github.io/xmm-client/](https://ircam-rnd.github.io/xmm-client/)\n\n#### es6 example :\n\n```JavaScript\nimport { PhraseMaker, HhmmDecoder } from 'xmm-client';\nconst phraseMaker = new PhraseMaker({\n\tcolumn_names: ['gyrAlpha', 'gyrBeta', 'gyrGamma'],\n\tlabel: 'someGesture'\n});\n\nconst hhmmDecoder = new HhmmDecoder();\n```\n\n#### credits :\n\nThis library is developed by the [ISMM](http://ismm.ircam.fr/) team at IRCAM,\nwithin the context of the [RAPID-MIX](http://rapidmix.goldsmithsdigital.com/)\nproject, funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.  \nOriginal XMM code authored by Jules Françoise, ported to JavaScript by Joseph Larralde.  \nSee [github.com/Ircam-RnD/xmm](https://github.com/Ircam-RnD/xmm) for detailed XMM credits.",
