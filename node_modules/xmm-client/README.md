# xmm-client
### XMM model decoders for the browser

This library is intended to be used with the
[original XMM library](https://github.com/Ircam-RnD/xmm), or its Node.js wrapper
[xmm-node](https://github.com/Ircam-RnD/xmm-node), which takes care of turning phrases
and training sets into statistical models, besides allowing to do exactly the same
things as xmm-client, server-side.

xmm-client contains 4 classes :
- PhraseMaker, which eases the creation of XMM-compatible phrases
(i.e. time series recordings of dimension n, packed with metadata into JS objects),
that can then be passed to XMM.
- SetMaker, which eases the management of training sets, aka collections of Phrases.
A SetMaker should only contain phrases with the same configuration (bimodality, dimension,
input dimension, column names), only labels and lengths may vary.
Training sets can also be passed to XMM directly to generate a corresponding GMM
or HHMM model.
- GmmDecoder, which takes a GMM model generated by XMM and outputs
some estimation results when it's fed with an input vector
- HhmmDecoder, which does the same with a Hierarchical HMM model generated by XMM.

#### installation :

`npm install [--save] Ircam-RnD/xmm-client`

#### documentation :

#### es6 example :

```JavaScript
import { PhraseMaker, HhmmDecoder } from 'xmm-client';
const phraseMaker = new PhraseMaker({
	column_names: ['gyrAlpha', 'gyrBeta', 'gyrGamma'],
	label: 'someGesture'
});

const hhmmDecoder = new HhmmDecoder();
```
